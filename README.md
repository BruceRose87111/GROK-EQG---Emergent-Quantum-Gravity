Emergent Quantum Gravity (EQG) is a phenomenological framework with a Group Field
Theory (GFT)-derived deformation that proposes a mechanism for gravity, dark matter, and
dark energy in strict 4D using Planck-scale spinfoam perturbations.

Hypothesis: Spacetime is a discrete SU(2) spinfoam network compressed by energy-mass.
The compression density ρ(t) (phenomenological, motivated by Loop Quantum Cosmology
(LQC) volume scaling and GFT condensate conservation) drives holographic entropy gradients,
producing an entropic gravitational force. The functional form ρ(t) = ρ0/ sinh3(√Λ/3t) is
chosen to match late-time acceleration while preserving UV bounce behavior.
This model extends LQG (Rovelli) and GFT (Oriti) while incorporating entropic gravity
(Verlinde).

Construction: A single deformation of spinfoam face amplitudes generates: - Newtonian
and post-Newtonian gravity, - Dark matter as SU(3) GFT glueballs (10–50 GeV gamma lines), -
Dark energy from global ρ(t) dilution (evolving w(z)).

Three sharp, near-term falsifiable predictions, potentially consistent with O4 Grav-
ity Wave (GW) damping hints and congruent with the Einstein–Rosen bridge and Ein-
stein–Podolsky–Rosen (ER=EPR) entanglement:

1. 10–20% suppression of CMB power at ℓ ≲ 20 (falsified if |∆Cℓ|/Cℓ < 5%);
2. Isotropic 10–50 GeV monochromatic gamma-ray lines detectable by the Cherenkov
Telescope Array (CTA);
3. Modified tensor-mode tilt ∆nT̸ = 0 observable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA) and the proposed successor to LISA, the Big Bang Observer (BBO).
